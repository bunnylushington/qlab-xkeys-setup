# Xkeys + QLab + Nomad

## About

Included in this repository are some tools for configuring an Xkeys
XK-60 to assist with ETCnomad and QLab programming.

[Documentation](https://bunnylushington.github.io/qlab-xkeys-setup/)
is available.


## Contents

The **xkeys** directory contains the macro definition file and the
legends file.  For convenience, the legends are also included as a
printable PDF.

The **qlab** directory contains a QLab V4 template file populated with
a handful of script cues.  Some of these cues are programmed with
hotkeys directly mapped to the XK-60.

The **workflows** directory contains two MacOS quick actions that can
be installed in `~/Library/Services`.
